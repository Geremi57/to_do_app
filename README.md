## 🧠 Programming Paradigms & Patterns

### 💡 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- The app uses classes to encapsulate logic:
  - `Task`: Handles individual task data, parsing time, rendering, and countdown logic.
  - `Modal`: Inherits from `Task`, handles uploading new tasks and rendering modals.

### 📦 Modular Design
- All logic is encapsulated within classes and clean functions.
- Event listeners are organized by feature and bound properly.

### 🧼 Declarative & Imperative Mix
- Declarative: Uses `.innerHTML` and template strings to build the DOM in a readable way.
- Imperative: DOM events and countdown logic are handled step-by-step (setInterval, classList manipulations, etc.)

### ♻️ DRY Principles
- Task rendering and event bindings are abstracted to avoid repetition.
- Countdown logic is reused for both inline and modal displays.

## 📱 Responsive Design

The UI adapts gracefully to different screen sizes:

- Modals scale based on viewport width/height.
- Inputs and buttons are touch-friendly.
- On smaller screens:
  - Task notes resize vertically.
  - Modal content and buttons realign automatically.
